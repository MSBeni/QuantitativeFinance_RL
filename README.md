# README # 
 
This README would normally document the project provided here. In this project, in addition to data gathering techniques, 
the process of financial analysis in stock market and cryptocurrency network will be analyzed. 
Moreover, Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are used to make a market portfolio manager engine.

### What is this repository for? ### 
 
* Architecture, networking and client/server architecture, request/response pattern, RFC standards defined by the IETF
* Templates and the role they play in server-side programming, and how to work with them with Go's standard libraries, modifying data structures to work well with templates
* Servers,relationship between TCP and HTTP, building TCP server by responding to HTTP requests, Creating TCP server which responds to HTTP requests and creating TCP server which handles various routes and methods, work on  web server, servemux, multiplexer, and mux
* Streamlining web development with net/http package, the handler interface and http.ListenAndServe, http.NotFoundHandler 
* creating servemux, http.Handle & http.Handler, http.Handlefunc, func(ResponseWriter, *Request), & http.HandlerFunc, http.ServeContent, http.ServeFile, & http.FileServer
* State & Sessions and deployment, Amazon Web Services
* Work on SQL and NoSQL databases, specifically work on ArangoDN a NoSQL database and different sample codes and Queries workin on this database and also covering other databases like MySQL, MongoDB, SQlite, PostgresQL and InfluxDB

## About Golang 
Go, or Golang, is an open source programming language developed at Google. The designers of Go wanted developers to have a programming language that made it quick and easy to develop applications at scale. Go is used on servers, web development, and even command line interafaces. 
Go is one of the most powerful, performant, and scalable programming language today for creating web applications, web APIâ€™s, microservices, and other distributed services.
 
 ## About Golang 
 Different test data is prepared in this project in order to be uploaded to the arangodb database and be used in different sections of the project.

 ## What Is Considered In This Project 
 different materials necessary to be covered in order to enable you to work with the Golang web is tried to be implmented in this project.
